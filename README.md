# Malware Development in Go

For educational purposes I will be consolidating my 
research into malware development in Go to this repository. 

Some packages will be available via `go get` for others
to use, but these aren't meant to be stable and may change at any point
so use at own risk.

## TODO: 

### Sample Malware for Testing

### [Process Injection](process-injection)
 - [x] [Process Injection](process-injection/injection.go)
 - [ ] Process Hollowing
 - [ ] Process Doppelg√§nging
