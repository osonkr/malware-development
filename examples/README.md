# Examples

These examples are intended to assist the other
areas of the project. `calc` pops a simple calculator
and `keylogger` is a basic userland keylogger that utilizes
windows hooks. 

The keylogger example has DLL support and can be compiled to a DLL for 
injection:

```powershell
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o keylogger.dll .
```

The main function invoked the `Start` method of the keylogger and writes the output
to `C:\Windows\temp\keylogger.out` and can be used as an executable in PIE mode for Donut usage:
```powershell
go build -buildmode=pie -o keylogger.exe .
```

## Converting Go Binaries to Shellcode
I used [donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut) to convert go binaries to 
shellcode. In order to do this, the binaries need to be compiled as a DLL
or with `-buildmode=pie` per above instruction. 

In the near future I hope to better understand PE files and eliminate the donut dependency 
for this process.
