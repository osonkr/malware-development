# Process Injection

> Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  -- [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)



***Do not inject a golang binary into a golang process, the runtime will panic***

## Process Injection
This most basic form of process injection involves win32 APIS: 
- `OpenProcess` to get a process handle.
- `VirtualAllocEx` to allocate memory in the process.
- `WriteProcessMemory` to write the arbitrary code the new allocated memory region.
- `CreateRemoteThread` to create a new thread at the base address of the memory region.

If injecting a DLL then you will need to call an additional API: `LoadLibrary` in the thread
to load in the DLL. 

Both methods have been implemented: `Inject` and `InjectDLL`
